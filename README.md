## TO DO

Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. The link should take you to a guide on how to use the 5 Day Forecast API. You will need to register for an API key in order to use this API. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

## Acceptance Criteria

    - The temperature
    - The humidity
  - When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
