## TO DO

Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities. The link should take you to a guide on how to use the 5 Day Forecast API. You will need to register for an API key in order to use this API. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  - When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  - When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    - The city name
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
    - The wind speed
  - When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    - The date
    - An icon representation of weather conditions
    - The temperature
    - The humidity
  - When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
